# Data Cleaner 
This project is designed to process, validate, and clean raw JSON data from multiple sources. The data is then aggregated and stored in a structured format for further analysis or use.

## File structure
`app/DataCleaner.py`: The main script that defines the `DataCleaner` class and contains methods for processing and cleaning the raw data.  
`data/`: Directory containing raw JSON data files (e.g., proficiency.json, skills.json, data.json).  

## Running the app
To run the project, run the `DataCleaner.py` file, which will read in the input data files from the `data` directory and write output files to the `output` folder.
